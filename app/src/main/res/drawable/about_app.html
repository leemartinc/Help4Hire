<p class="p1">Imagine this…..</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You are working parent of two toddlers, a golden retriever, and we just bought a new house that you are sprucing up for the growing family. You need a baby sitter multiple days a week, a dog sitter at times, and are in need to hire specialized workers for various things that you need spruced up in the house.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">With this app, you can hire people for the services you need.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">How it works:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p1">Easily type in the service you need, location, and dates to get a list of people you can hire for your purpose. Normally, it takes a lot of research and asking around to find the right people, and if you don’t have that much time between work, kids, and everything else, this is where this app can help</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To cut short that time, this app has information we can trust because it is provided by real people around you. You will be able to see each workers ratings/ reviews as well as their hourly rate including a description of the work they perform.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">To make things even simpler, you will be able to get an estimate on how much money and time it will take to do the task before you hire the person.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">Once hired, you will be able to communicate with the person through the app so it’s all in one place. With the number of messaging apps there are these days, it’s so easy to lose track of things.</p>
<p class="p2"><br></p>
<p class="p1">You can also keep track of the hours they have worked through the app and be able to seamlessly pay the provider through the app. Additionally, we would like to be able to have GPS tracking for the workers when they are performing certain services - for example, if the baby sitter is taking our child to the park or somewhere, you will be able to see where they are. Same with your dog, if the dog sitter is walking your dog.</p>
